However, Taft's administration faced significant challenges, including a growing split within the Republican Party that ultimately led to the rise of progressive factions and his eventual loss to Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election. Taft's legacy is complex, as he later became the only person to serve as Chief Justice of the United States after his presidency.",
