He did not write down his teachings but influenced many through dialogues recorded by his disciples, notably Plato. Passionate about ethics and morality, Socrates believed in questioning one's life and values. An interesting fact about Socrates is his trial and execution for 'corrupting the youth,' which solidified his philosophy's enduring impact. He left behind a powerful legacy, expressed in his saying, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.'",

His contributions include the 'Theory of Forms,' which suggests non-material abstract forms, and are more real than the material world. An interesting aspect of his philosophy is the 'Allegory of the Cave,' representing the philosopher's journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Plato founded the Academy, one of the earliest institutions of higher learning in the Western world. He famously said, 'The measure of a man is what he does with power.'",

Known for his philosophical empiricism, he believed knowledge comes from experience, unlike his predecessors who trusted intuition. A student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great, Aristotle's works laid the foundation in many fields, from natural sciences to political theory. He argued the concept of 'syllogism' and emphasized the importance of reason, stating, 'Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.'",
